## JavaScript (JS) Basics

### 1. What is JavaScript?

- A **scripting language** mainly used for making web pages interactive.
- Works **inside browsers** but can also be used on servers (Node.js).
- It is **not the same as Java** (they just have similar names).

---

### 2. Who Created JavaScript?

- Created by **Brendan Eich** in **1995** at **Netscape**.
- Originally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, and finally **JavaScript**.
- Developed in just **10 days**.

---

### 3. Why Was JavaScript Created?

- To make **webpages dynamic** instead of just showing static HTML.
- It allowed **buttons, animations, pop-ups, and user interactions**.

### 4. Uses of JavaScript

| Use Case                  | Description                                      |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Web Development**       | Adds interactivity (buttons, forms, effects).   |
| **Mobile Apps**          | Used in frameworks like React Native.          |
| **Game Development**      | Simple browser games (e.g., Chrome Dino Game). |
| **Server-Side Development** | With **Node.js**, it can run on servers.     |
| **Machine Learning & AI** | Libraries like TensorFlow.js.                   |

### 5. What Do You Need to Run JavaScript?

- A **web browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- A **text editor** (VS Code, Sublime, or even Notepad).
- To run outside a browser, use **Node.js**.

---

### 6. Interesting Facts About JavaScript

- **JS runs on almost every website** (over **98%** of websites use it).
- **It is loosely typed** – No need to declare variable types.
- **JS can run directly inside the browser's console** (try `console.log("Hello, World!");`).
- **ECMAScript (ES)** – The standard that defines JavaScript features.
- **JS can be used for ethical hacking** – Many security tools use JS for automation.

## What is a Scripting Language?

- A **scripting language** is a type of programming language used to **automate tasks**.
- It is usually **interpreted** (runs line by line) instead of compiled.
- Examples: **JavaScript, Python, Bash, PHP**.

### How is a Scripting Language Different from Other Languages?

| Feature          | Scripting Languages (JS, Python) | Compiled Languages (C, Java) |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Execution**   | Runs **line by line** (interpreted) | Runs **all at once** (compiled) |
| **Speed**       | Slower (interpreted) | Faster (compiled to machine code) |
| **Usage**       | **Automating tasks, web development** | **System software, performance-heavy apps** |
| **Example**     | JavaScript (web), Python (automation) | C (OS development), Java (large apps) |

---

## Other Types of Programming Languages

Not all programming languages are scripting languages. Some are **compiled** and work differently.

### Main Types of Languages:

| Type                | Examples             | Usage                                  |
|---------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Compiled Languages** | C, C++, Rust, Java, Go | System software, high-performance apps, games |
| **Interpreted Languages** | Python, Ruby, JavaScript | Web, automation, AI, scripting tasks |
| **Markup Languages** | HTML, XML | Webpage structure, data formatting |
| **Query Languages** | SQL | Fetching data from databases |
| **Assembly Language** | x86 Assembly | CPU-specific programming |

---

## What is ECMAScript?

- **ECMAScript (ES)** is the **official standard** that defines JavaScript.
- Created by **ECMA International** to make JavaScript consistent.
- Every new **JavaScript update follows ECMAScript rules**.

### Important ECMAScript Versions:

| Version | Features |
|---------|----------|
| **ES5 (2009)** | JSON support, `strict mode`. |
| **ES6 (2015)** | Let/const, arrow functions, promises, template literals. |
| **ES7, ES8, ES9...** | Async/await, object features, better performance. |

**JavaScript is just an implementation of ECMAScript.**
