##  What is Node.js?

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. It is primarily used for building scalable network applications, such as web servers and real-time applications.

##  Why Was Node.js Created?

Ryan Dahl wanted to improve how web applications handle multiple connections simultaneously. Traditional web servers (like Apache) used a blocking model, which was inefficient for handling large-scale, real-time applications. Node.js was created to:

- Provide **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**.
- Improve **scalability** and **performance**.
- Make **JavaScript a full-stack language**, enabling both frontend and backend development.
